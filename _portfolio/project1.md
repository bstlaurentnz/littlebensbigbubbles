There are two different sized wands available. The small size is 30cm and is wonderfully suited for all ages. Even very young children (2 years old) can manage these wands. The longer wand is 60cm long and is best suited for older children and adults. A young child can use the larger wands with a lot of practice (my son mastered the big ones at 3 years) but will be a lot happier with a smaller wand. Huge bubbles will come out of the 30cm wand too!

These wands can be customized in any combination of tapes, please look at your options in the pictures below. The example picture below-right shows you some of the amazing combos you can have.

30cm wands are $5.
60cm wands are $10.
