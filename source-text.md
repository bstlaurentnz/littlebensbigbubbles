Wand Sticks: 

There are two different sized wands available. The small size is 30cm and is wonderfully suited for all ages. Even very young children (2 years old) can manage these wands. The longer wand is 60cm long and is best suited for older children and adults.

Soap Solution:

This bubble solution will make big bubbles which are rainbow coloured and can last a very long time on a windless day. It is capable under the right conditions with practice, of making bubbles that could easily hold an adult inside.

The story:

As a child I remember making giant bubbles at my grandma’s house in the summer. I wanted to recreate that joyful experience for my son. And then I wanted to share the bubbles with everyone else. This is how Little Ben's Big Bubbles began.

Welcome to Little Ben's Big Bubbles:

As child I remember making giant bubbles at my grandma’s house in the summer. She had collected labels for months to mail away for a special bubble wand. When I became a mom I wanted to replicate the same thrill and joy of those big bubbles with my little boy. As a teacher, I also strive to turn play activities into learning opportunities (for a story on using wands with children with autism click here). Once I made my first wands and solution and began to use it, people began to ask where I bought it? How could they get some? Thus began Little Ben’s Big Bubbles.

Big bubble solution and bubble wands
Made for little people, and big people too.

For Educators:

Children with Special Needs and Bubbles.
What can bubbles do? Bring people together.

I recently brought my bubbles to a kindy where there was child with autism. They did not engage in the big bubbles or wands but after everyone left they quietly put their hands the bubble solution and rubbed their hands together feeling the texture. I quietly approached and dipped my hands into the solution and made a circle using my thumb and index finger and gently blew a bubble. They stopped and stared! They sat next to me and gestured for me to do it again.  After a couple more demos they tried themselves.  When they finally got a bubble formed they squealed.  Their excitement drew a couple of children over.  The children watched fascintated as the child with autism blew another bubble.  "Can we try too ____?", they asked.  The child nodded and the three of them continued to blow hand bubbles together until I took the solution away at lunch time.  I left some solution with the TA. When I went back the TA told me that the bubbles had left such an impression on the child that they would ask for them, commuicating "bubble" clearly.  They extended the desire for bubbles by telling the child with autism to find two people to come do bubbles with them.  The child had to ask two friends to play and then share the bubble solution with them.

 

Bubbles: good for communication and social interaction opportunities.

FAQS:
How do I care for my wand? 
To make your wand last longer after you are done making bubbles you need to rinse the strings in clean water. Run water over it, give it a gentle squeeze, run more water over it until it feels like no more bubble solution is coming out (it will never be completely clear of solution) and then allow it to dry. Do not hang it by the strings, drape the dowels over something (table edge, bathtub, etc)

How do I make a bubble with my wands? 
Dip the wand into the solution, immersing them completely to the tips. Slowly raise it up and keep the tips of the sticks together. Slowly open the sticks. Opening the sticks fully creates larges tubes or large bubbles. Making a small partial gap in the triangle will result in many smaller bubbles. When starting the bubble making for the session, it will require 4-5 dips and bubble attempts to really soak the wand fully. If your wand strings were wet prior to starting you may need up to a dozen dips to get back to full capacity.

Watch the video on tips and tricks for clarification.

What happens if I get some solution in my eye or mouth? 
If a bubble pops and you get some in an eye rinse with water for a few seconds. If you get a large amount in eyes flush with water for a couple of minutes. If you get some in mouth, drink water and spit. If some is drunk (it tastes horrible I don’t see how but...) give lots of water and call Healthline/doctor/poison control.

How to store and use your bubble solution. 
Bubble solution is best stored in a cool, dark place. Sediment settling to the bottom is normal.
Prior to using for bubble making stir the solution so that the sediment is redistributed through the mix. You can shake the container vigorously, then give it a few minutes for the foam to settle.
If there is a lot of foam in the container you are dipping into you can scoop off the foam with a spoon so that you just have liquid to dip into.
